# Options PNL Plotter
 This project is designed to help you visualize and analyze the Profit and Loss (PNL) potential of various option strategies based on user-provided information.

**Overview**

Options trading can be complex, and evaluating the potential outcomes of different strategies is crucial for making informed decisions. The Option PNL Plotter simplifies this process by allowing you to specify your options and stock-related data. It then generates PNL plots to help you visualize how your chosen strategy may perform under various market conditions.

**Key Features**
* **Customizable Strategies:** Specify the number of options and stocks you plan to use, as well as their details such as action (call or put), buy/sell status, strike price, and option price.

* **Stock Information:** Input the spot price of the underlying stock to make the analysis context-specific.
